# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection 💳
## Developing a Fraud Detection Model
In this project, I have designed a fraud detection model using a Logistic Classifier and Decision Tree to predict fraud based on the given data.This project is mainly focused on credit card fraud and the data given
also has features of a credit card. It is quite a basic ML model project but it has helped me develop foundational skills on how ML models should be built and yes it has definitely made me more interested in
ML models! 😄
## Technologies 👩‍💻
- Python: Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning: Scikit Learn
## Process
- Conducted data cleaning and exploratory data analysis and created 5+ types of visualizations to understand the data
- Performed undersampling to handle the huge imbalance in the dataset, resulting in around 15% faster performance of the dataset.
- Designed a Fraud Detection model using a Logistic Classifier with 93% accuracy, a Decision Tree with 95% accuracy, and Random Forest Classifier with 96% prediction accuracy.
